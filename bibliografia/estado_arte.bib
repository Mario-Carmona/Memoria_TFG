	abstract={The use of chatbots evolved rapidly in numerous fields in recent years, including Marketing, Supporting Systems, Education, Health Care, Cultural Heritage, and Entertainment. In this paper, we first present a historical overview of the evolution of the international community’s interest in chatbots. Next, we discuss the motivations that drive the use of chatbots, and we clarify chatbots’ usefulness in a variety of areas. Moreover, we highlight the impact of social stereotypes on chatbots design. After clarifying necessary technological concepts, we move on to a chatbot classification based on various criteria, such as the area of knowledge they refer to, the need they serve and others. Furthermore, we present the general architecture of modern chatbots while also mentioning the main platforms for their creation. Our engagement with the subject so far, reassures us of the prospects of chatbots and encourages us to study them in greater extent and depth.},

	abstract={Abstract Chatbots are intelligent conversational agents that can interact with users through natural languages. As chatbots can perform a variety of tasks, many companies have committed numerous resources to develop and deploy chatbots to enhance various business processes. However, we lack an up-to-date critical review that thoroughly examines both state-of-the-art technologies and innovative applications of chatbots. In this review, we not only critically analyze the various computational approaches used to develop state-of-the-art chatbots, but also thoroughly review the usability and applications of chatbots for various business sectors. We also identify gaps in chatbot-related studies and propose new research directions to address the shortcomings of existing studies and applications. Our review advances both academic research and practical business applications of state-of-the-art chatbots. We provide guidance for practitioners to fully realize the business value of chatbots and assist in making sensible decisions related to the development and deployment of chatbots in various business contexts. Researchers interested in the design and development of chatbots can also gain useful insights from our critical review and identify fruitful research topics and future research directions based on the research gaps discussed herein.

For years, customers have been able to order pizzas via &#34;Dom,&#34; a simple ordering bot available online and through the company&#39;s mobile apps. &#34;We&#39;re one of the first in this space to launch our own artificially intelligent voice-ordering assistant through our own native apps,&#34; says Mandi Galluch, Domino&#39;s program leader for digital experience. Determined always to innovate and keep pace with ever-changing consumer behavior, the company turned to building rich conversational experiences powered by natural language understanding (NLU) and machine learning.},
